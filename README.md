# 11 AWS Developer Courses That Will Actually Help You Build Skills

I’ll never forget my first assignment involving AWS. I was tasked with deploying a small Node.js app using EC2, S3, and DynamoDB. I thought I could just “figure it out” as I went. Within hours, I was drowning in IAM permissions, VPCs, and cryptic billing settings. What I assumed would be a weekend project turned into weeks of trial and error.

That experience taught me something important: you can’t really wing it with AWS. The platform is too vast, too interconnected. You need a roadmap. That’s where the right courses come in—not just tutorials on spinning up an EC2 instance, but courses that teach you how to think like an AWS developer.

By 2026, AWS will continue to dominate the cloud market, with millions of developers building apps and infrastructure on its services. Whether you’re aiming for the AWS Certified Developer Associate exam, building serverless applications, or managing full-stack projects, the right courses will save you time and frustration.

I’ve pulled together the best courses for AWS developer you can take this year. My top recommendation is Educative.io’s Master AWS Certified Developer, because it’s interactive, hands-on, and structured around the skills developers actually need. But I’ve also included solid picks from Udemy, Coursera, A Cloud Guru, and free options from AWS itself.

Because of its interactive format, you don’t just read or watch videos—you write code, see the results, and understand why AWS services behave the way they do. That makes it one of the best courses for AWS developer at any stage, but especially for those preparing for certification while also building real-world skills.
